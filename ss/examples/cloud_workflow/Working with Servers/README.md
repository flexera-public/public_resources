## Working with Servers

These definitions are useful when manually manipulating Server declarations. Usually, a server is launched using the `provision()` function, but sometimes you may need to manually launch a server. 

### Required permissions

Since all actions defined in these helpers only require `actor` privileges, no additional explicit permissions are required.
